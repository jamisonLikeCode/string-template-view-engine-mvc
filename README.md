### What is it?

An alternate, lightweight view engine for the ASP.Net MVC framework, built on top of the popular StringTemplate engine.
What makes it different?

* Lightweight. No page classes are created.
* Fast. Templates are written to the Response Output stream.
* Cached. Templates are cached for a specified amount of time (when in release mode).
* Dynamic. Templates can be generated on the fly in code.
* Flexible. Templates can be nested to any level.
* In line with MVC principles. Promotes separation of UI and Business Logic. All data is created ahead of time, and passed down to the template.
